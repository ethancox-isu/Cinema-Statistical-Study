# Introduction
Movie production companies communicate through multimodal marketing to engage as wide an audience as possible and make as much money as possible. They market their movie through digital marketing, events, merchandise, partnerships, and traditional methods (billboards, posters, etc.). Their audience is the general movie-goers, who are targeted to obsess over the next blockbuster.

# Research Question
Is there a significant statistical difference between the profits of movies before the COVID-19 Pandemic (2018) and after (2022)?

# Description
This question interests me because I like movies and I’ve wondered if movie theaters are significantly dying post-pandemic, in part due to new streaming services and home-releases. I chose 2018 and 2022 specifically because the year is just before the pandemic or just after theater re-openings, respectively. I also think it will be interesting to see if people are getting burnt out from the growing number of blockbusters being released year-round. My claim is that there is a significant statistical difference because of singular profit and budget reports I have read over the last few years, as well as the general discussion about theater attendance post- pandemic. In my opinion, the growth of the blockbuster has been a major issue these last 20 or so years. In the 90’s, 80’s and 70’s, blockbusters were special summer events, and now they multiple release monthly year-round. This is not an isolated issue but is indicative of the larger factors affecting the economy, such as corporate greed, dissent from creativity, mass-production, and the turn from art to “content”/products. However, good movies made by passionate filmmakers are still being made but are just becoming harder and harder to find. You would think from my claims that I prefer solely older movies, but my 2nd favorite movie came out in just 2022 (Aftersun by Charlotte Wells). Going into this study, I don’t think my claim will be disproven, but I am excited to see the specific statistical findings for movies in these two years, like which ones made a lot of profit while only working with a smaller budget compared to others on these lists.
